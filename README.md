## Introduction

The Virtual College Tour project is designed to provide an immersive experience for prospective students, parents, and visitors to explore the college campus virtually. Utilizing the power of Three.js, the project offers a first-person perspective to navigate through the 3D model of the college.

## Features

- **First-Person Navigation**: Users can move around the campus as if they were walking in real life.
- **3D Model**: A detailed 3D representation of the college campus.
- **Interactive Experience**: Users can interact with different parts of the campus.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/virtual-college-tour.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```sh
    cd virtual-college-tour
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then run:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

4. **Run the project**:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

## Usage

After starting the project, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You will see the 3D model of the college campus. Use the following controls to navigate:

- **W**: Move forward
- **S**: Move backward
- **A**: Move left
- **D**: Move right
- **Mouse**: Look around

## File Structure

### main.js

Contains the main Three.js code, including the setup of the scene, camera, renderer, and loading of the 3D college model.

### player.js

Handles the first-person perspective, including controls for moving and looking around the campus.

## Technologies Used

- **[Three.js](https://threejs.org/)**: A JavaScript 3D library that makes WebGL simpler.
- **[GLTFLoader](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/loaders/GLTFLoader)**: For loading the 3D model.
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)**: JavaScript runtime for the server.
- **[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)**: Module bundler to manage project dependencies.
